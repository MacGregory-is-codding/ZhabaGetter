# ZhabaGetter

## What is it?

This is my first application in The Ring programming language. Yeah, this project is far from ideal
But ideal architecture or elegant and fast solution were'nt the target. So, here is the target:

- I wanted to try The Ring (yeah, that's cool, but The Ring is pure language)
- I wanted work with third-party API's and parse some JSON's (it would be better to do it in Python, Ruby etc because I didn't find a json library in The Ring -.- )
- I wanted to understand MVC pattern
- I wanted some frogs and toads *-* (btw, "zhaba" is "frog" in russian)

## Ending

So... I am waiting oh your help in MVC, project architecture, programming etc if you want. Thank u)
